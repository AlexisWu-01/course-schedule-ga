# Course Scheduling with Genetic Algorithm
## Introduction
Course scheduling requires lots of considerations, from time slots on different weekdays to professor and classroom assignment. We also need to adjust for student preference: they take some course combinations together.  It certainly takes loads of time and brain to make the perfect decision but we could use computers to help us. Here we are using genetic algorithm to help school registrar generate a course schedule that makes most of the students and staff happy.
